# Testing ML Pipeline training

Welcome to the ML Testing training!

## :wrench: Developer set up

To take part in the training course you will need to clone this repository and set up the local development environment.

First clone the repo. In a terminal, navigate to a folder you want to clone the code to then run:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/danalyticsuk/ml_test_training.git

We will use conda for the virtual environment for this training. To get this set up, you will need to have anaconda already installed on your machine. To set it up and activate run:

```bash
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
